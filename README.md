# Behavioral Analysis and Machine Learning Interface

## Overview
At CREDIT AGRICOLE ASSURANCE between January 2022 and March 2022, I worked on a project that involved setting up a behavioral analysis, anticipating the phenomenon of substitution using machine learning models, and developing a graphical user interface for utilizing these models.

## Key Achievements

### Behavioral Analysis
- Conducted a comprehensive behavioral analysis to understand and interpret patterns, trends, and insights from the data.

### Machine Learning for Substitution Phenomenon
- Employed advanced machine learning algorithms including RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and Xgboost.
- Built models to anticipate the phenomenon of substitution, aiding in making informed decisions.

### Graphical User Interface Development
- Developed a user-friendly graphical interface using Dash Plotly.
- The interface streamlines the process of using machine learning models, making them more accessible to non-technical users.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: RandomForest, ExtraTrees, Xgboost
- **Development Tools**: Dash Plotly
